            A private nonprofit organization founded in 1973, Philadelphia Corporation for Aging (PCA) is the fourth largest in a nationwide 
            network of Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) and the largest in Pennsylvania. PCA coordinates a broad range of services that
             help older Philadelphians live as independently as possible, including: care at home, advocacy, caregiver support, 
             employment assistance, health promotion, home repair, information and referral, legal assistance, home-delivered meals, 
             protective services, senior community centers, transportation, and many more.

             This site was built on Wordpress. In order to create an efficient and flexible website for such a large amount of content, 
            the I developed modular, custom blocks to work with WordPress Block editor AKA Gutenberg. In conjunction with Our design team,  I developed all the different kinds of blocks needed. 
            Working with my designers high-fidelity wireframes, I tested on every page in order to ensure the custom blocks were flexible enough to handle all the different
            kinds of content. The added benefit  to the client was providing a roadmap for its content writers when developing content for the new pages.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most blocks could appear in any order on the page and all blocks are fully responsive. Each block type was designed with 
            flexibility in mind, easily adjusting to various quantities of information and controlled by easy-to-use selectors on the admin panel of WordPress.
            Another benefit of the block system is that we could design the site without having final content. 
            The website's content was written in parallel with its design and development, resulting in a seamless and efficient process.

NERCOMP, the NorthEast Regional Computing Program, is a professional organization for university and college information technology 
professionals. With almost 300 member institutions and over 10,000 individual members, NERCOMP organizes professional conferences
 and workshops, facilitates vendor licensing discounts, and provides various other resources and benefits to its members.

             This site was built on Wordpress. 
             I was tasked to develop a fully responsive website that focused on meeting WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and creating an effective user experience.
            <br>
            <br>
             For NERCOMP's job board, I developed and refined the filtering UI to be able to filter jobs by location and type. The result was significant increase in applications of interested job candidates.
             I developed a website wizard system to launch along with the site, smoothing the transition for users who were accustomed to the previous site. 
             When a user arrived for the first time, they would be greeted by a welcome message and could opt-in for a tour of the new changes. There were also helpful tips on pages that had more custom functionality, ensuring that all users felt comfortable with the new organization and functionality of the site.

            The Siegfried Group is a professional organization that provides Fortune 1000 organizations with teams of accounting and finance experts, and has a large focus on cultivating professionals into strong leaders. 
            Their MY Journey® program includes multiple annual events, bringing together employees for an immersive experience of leadership exercises.
             <br>
             <br>
             I was lead developer on this project and built this site using Vue.js and Vuex to manage data and storage.
             The task was to develop an interactive experience that showcased the energetic and ambitious spirit of the MY Journey® events. 
             The main goal of the site was to serve as a marketing tool—attracting potential employees and enticing them to join the firm, by positioning the MY Journey® program as a unique job benefit. 
            Facing the challenge of how to immerse users in a virtual experience that conveyed the energy and experience of the program, I explored ideas on how to develope a way to guide users across the site in a way that encapsulated the “journey” of the program—while also adding interactivity and movement.
            <br>
            <br>
            With the collaboration of my designers, we took full advantage of available space on desktop screens, displaying large scale animated graphics and visuals along with text and navigational elements.
            However, with the limited space on mobile devices, we needed a solution that reduced the number of elements shown at once.
            Mobile user’s can choose to either listen and watch the animated visuals, or to listen and read along—using the full screen to showcase their selected experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            In order make content dynamic and simple to replace and change I utilized WordPress JSON REST API to allow for contact change on the Wordpress content management system.

            For this project, I utilized the Google Civics API to allow a user to enter their
            residential address and show them all of their government representatives from federal
            to local level and contact them by mail, phone, and social media. I integrated Google
            Places API to auto-complete addresses and developed the back end with Node.js and
            Express. During election season, this app also will tell you your polling location and
            the hours of operation.
